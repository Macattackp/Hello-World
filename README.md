# Hello-World
First repository on GitHub... Hello everyone!

I am still learning as a programmer but I have enjoyed what I have done so far. I hope to improve in C# and eventually hit a place where I not only know HOW to code but also WHY code works the way it does. That will take a lot of work however so I ask that you bear with me until then. I hope the day comes soon where I can help you all as much as you help me!
